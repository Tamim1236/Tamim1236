## Hi there, I'm Tamim - [more about me][website]

### I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto    
- I enjoy solving problems, building, and exploring more in AI, Engineering, and Software.
- Recently I interned at Jule (https://www.julepower.com) , an Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Company that builds their own EV chargers and battery systems.
  I worked there as a software engineering intern writing communication protocols in Golang for our chargers to connect to various backend systems.
  I also worked on building an object detection pipeline that allows us to identify make/model of cars that connect to our chargers, using a USB camera installed in our chargers
  and python code deployed onto Jetson Nanos installed within the inner hardware of a given charger unit.
- Currently, I am learning more about AI and lower level development and am spending most of my time dabbling with math and C.
- I also continue to read, watch, and learn more about tech, watching podcasts, and playing with AI tools (here's a site where I post by Midjourney art: https://tamim1236.github.io/Midjourney-Art-Gallery/)
- Reach out if you'd ever like to chat!
